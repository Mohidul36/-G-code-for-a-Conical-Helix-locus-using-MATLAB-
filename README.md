# -G-code-for-a-Conical-Helix-locus-using-MATLAB-
I need a MATLAB code that can convert the code for a conical helix path into G-code for use in a multi-axis CNC milling machine. The milling tool will starts its operation from a null point on the job and work its way in a helical path along the length of the job gradually removing material, creating a conical surface until it reaches a maximum diameter. The user will have the liberty of specifying the angle of the cone from the vertex, the maximum diameter and the spacing between each rotation (i.e. the radial distance of the tool tip from the center).
